# Practice - Why XP practices will never work!

* Find and collect causes/reasons why XP practices cannot work at all
  * on technical level
  * process wise
  * from a human perspective
  * in real-world projects, organizations
* Now, try to solve the causes/reasons found.
  * What can be done to neutralize an effect and turn it into the opposite direction?
  * What experiments can be started trying to minimze barriers?
  * Which of the causes/reasons are not relevant at all having the right attitude?

# Thinking in Patterns & Antipatterns

A pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context.

An anti-pattern is a common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.

* ➡️ Architecture Patterns ➡️ Software Architecture Patterns ➡️ Patterns for xyz

## Examples

* **Anti-Pattern "Design by committee"** - The result of having many contributors to a design, but no unifying vision
* **SW Pattern "Facade"** - Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
