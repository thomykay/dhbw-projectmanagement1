# Lesson 03 - Preparations

## Github account

For working on the project you will need a GitHub account. It's a good idea in general as a software developer to have a GitHub account. More and more employment interviews start with looking at your GitHub account.

[Getting started with your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/onboarding/getting-started-with-your-github-account)

## Setup Git

Git is your essential mechanics to work with code and other artifacts. In context of the PM course we will make use of Github and Git as a content creation system.

[Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Setup your content editor

We will work with either IntelliJ (community edition is sufficient) or vscode. I have a slight preference to vscode, both is OK. Start with your personal preference, if there is any, otherwise default to vscode.
