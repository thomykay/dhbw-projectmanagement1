# Practice - What we've achieved together (1-2-4-All, 1-3-All)

* **What do you think has been the biggest achievement of the project management sessions in the last 3 months?**
  * individual | team
  * observable | hidden
  * intended | unintended

1. 1min‚è≤Ô∏è - individually, think about one achievement, worth noting. Emojisü•≥ & #hashtags allowed
2. Go in groups of 3 for 5min‚è≤Ô∏è and shape one achievement, build on previous ideas.

# Practice - Fishbowl

1. **Invitation**
   1. How did we work together to initiate the project, to plan, coordinate, review, to adjust our goals?
   2. Which challenges and new opportunities did unfold during the course?
   3. How might you take insights from course and apply them during the practice phase?
2. **How it works**
   1. 7+1 VIP chairs and the facilitator form an "inner circle". One chair stays empty. the outer circle listens.
   2. You can join the inner circle if you want to contribute. Then, one contributor leaves the inner circle.
