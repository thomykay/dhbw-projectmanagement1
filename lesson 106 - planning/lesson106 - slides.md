# Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint. This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.

The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.

## The Scrum Master Role

Team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use.

The **responsibilities** of this role include:

* Clearing obstacles
* Establishing an environment where the team can be effective
* Addressing team dynamics
* Ensuring a good relationship between the team and¬†product¬†owner as well as others outside the team
* Protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions.
* Support the team making coordination with other teams efficient and effective

The role does not generally have any actual authority. People filling this role have to lead from a position of influence, often taking a servant-leadership stance.

## Practice - Scrum Master Role Selection

* **Nomination** - moderator asks the team whether everyone has understood the description of the role ‚Äì if necessary, clarify relevant questions. Then everyone takes a piece of paper and a pencil and covertly writes down a nomination, which they think should fill in this role. Then listen to nominations and arguments for them.
* **What else to know?** - After completing the round, collect relevant and important information. no discussions ‚Äì only information is needed now.
* **(Re-)Nomination** - Opportunity to reconsider nominations, to change it, or to retain it. Everybody reads out their nomination again and presents the reasons for changing something or for sticking with it.
* **Nominees** - Discuss objections against nominees, find solutions, possibly drop nominations. Remaining nominees decide who fits best.
* **üéâCelebrate your result!**
