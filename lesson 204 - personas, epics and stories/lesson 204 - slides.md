## User Persona

User Persona is a **detailed real or hypothetical description of a typical end-user** of the product the team is developing.

Personas usually take the form of a written document with a photo, name, profession, style of living, and other important details.

## Epics & Stories

* **Epic** - a big, sketchy, coarse-grained story

* **User Story** - describes how a customer or user employs the product; it is told from the user’s perspective

See [10 Tips For Writing Good User Stories](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/)

1. Users Come First

* With these insights, build hypotheses
* With these hypotheses
    * shape personas (your primary persona)
    * shape epics -> stories
* Fill your product backlog (quality, not quantity)
* Make your work tangible: persona template, hypothesis, test cards, epics/stories
