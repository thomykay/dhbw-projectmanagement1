## Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* ### Individuals and interactions ↔️ over Processes and Tools

* ### Working Software ↔️ over Comprehensive Documentation

* ### Customer Collaboration ↔️ over Contract Negotiation

* ### Responding to Change ↔️ over Following a Plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
