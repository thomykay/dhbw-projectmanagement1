# Conway's Law

"Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

# Tuckman Model

Focus on the way in which a team tackles a task from the initial formation of the team through to the completion of the project.

# Goodhart's Law

* When a measure becomes a target, it is subsequently no longer a good measure.
* Or: When we set one specific goal, people will tend to optimize for that objective regardless of the consequences.

## Examples

* If an employee is rewarded by the number of cars sold each month, they will try to sell more cars, even at a loss.
* If you pay developers to fix bugs, you may get a sort of cobra effect: Bug bounties can incentivize breeding bugs the way cobra bounties incentivized breeding cobras.
