---
<!-- _backgroundColor: lightblue -->

## Check-in

This first sprint was like... \<one word\>

---

## Today

* Sprint Review
* Sprint Retrospective

---

## The Sprint Review

* is an informal meeting, no strict prescribed agenda
* should be valuable for the team _and_ stakeholders
* focuses on product outcome, what was achieved/learned
* if possible: looks at a potentially shippable product/service

### Recap

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to **inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations**. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

## Practice - Sprint Review

1. Nominate a delegate to join another team's review
2. Delegate joins the other team as an observer/stakeholder
    * What can we learn from the other team?
    * What can we bring to the other team?
3. Sprint Review (lightweight) facilitated by the Scrum Master. ⏲️20min
    * Use the proposed flow, if you like.
4. Delegates, debrief with the team. ⏲️5min
    * Share what they have experienced.
    * Appreciations welcome.
