# Sprint Planning (‚è≤Ô∏è12min)

* What are potential **users/customers** you could speak to?
* Which **tests/experiments** are fast and cheap to (in)validate your hypotheses?
* What could be a way to **demonstrate potential value** to potential users at the end of the sprint?

* Shape the initial **Product Backlog** and the **Sprint Backlog**. What's your **Sprint Goal**?
* Cope with the current level of ambiguity, dance with it
* Plan to go through **Learn/Build/Measure** multiple times in the sprint

---

# Expectations till next week

* Demonstrate to be able to come from planning to learning‚û°Ô∏èdoing as a team
* Find into your roles and how to interact.
* Make use of process(es) and tools (ie. Backlog refinement)
