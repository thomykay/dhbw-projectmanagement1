3. Those of you, who wants to make a call...
   1. What would be you concrete product idea based on the 4 topics provided? (2min) (pairs are fine as well)
   2. Find a Catchy name that helps to "sell" the idea
   3. Who would use it?
   4. ...to solve what?
   5. What would make it unique?
4. Pitch the product idea (‚è≤Ô∏è1min each)

2. [Team Agreements (Management 3.0)](https://management30.com/blog/team-agreements/)
3. [Liberating Structures - 1-2-4-All](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/1-1-2-4-all/)
4. [Project Vision (Roman Pichler)](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/the-product-vision-board/)

## Expectations until next week...


1. Use our [shared Wiki](https://github.com/dhbw-ka-pm/tinf22b6-shared/wiki) to do - per team:
   1. the product idea/proposal/vision, ideally as Canvas (use draw.io)
   2. team members (and roles known so far)
2. Setup Github teams and repositories -> Admins (naming scheme helps)

> We use this also as a communication back to "Web Engineering"
