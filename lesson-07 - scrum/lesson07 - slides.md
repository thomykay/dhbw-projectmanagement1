# Some Scrum History

* **1986**: The software development term scrum was first used in a paper titled **"The New New Product Development Game" by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka**. The term is borrowed from rugby, where a scrum is a formation of players.

* **1995**: **Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber** jointly presented a first public appearance of their paper called **‚ÄúThe Scrum Development process‚Äù** at Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications (OOPSLA) Conference, 1995 in Austin, Texas.

* **2001**: Sutherland, Schwaber, and fifteen associates got together in Snowbird, Utah, and drew the Agile Manifesto

# Practice - Fishbowl

1. **Invitation**
   1. How have the PM lectures so far enriched my perception about Project Management?
   2. How do I connect the dots now - between PM, Scrum and the work in my organization?
2. **How it works**
   1. 3+1 VIP chairs and the facilitator form an "inner circle". One chair stays empty. the outer circle listens.
   2. You can join the inner circle if you want to contribute. Then, one contributor leaves the inner circle.
