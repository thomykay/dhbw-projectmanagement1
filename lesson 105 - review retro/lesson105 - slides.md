# The Sprint Review

The purpose of the Sprint Review is to **inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations**. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees **collaborate on what to do next**. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

# Sprint Review - Schedule

One way to do it...

1. Look at **what** was achieved (and finished)
2. Start the conversation about the current state. **So what?**
3. Make adaptations about the future direction. **Now what?**

See [What, So What, Now What? WÂ³](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/)

# The Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to **plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness**.

The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to **individuals, interactions, processes, tools**, and their Definition of Done.

The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. **They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.**
