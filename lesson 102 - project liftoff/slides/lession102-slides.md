# Mental Models

Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do **they shape what we think and how we understand** but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see.

A mental model is simply **a representation of how something works**. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to **simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks**.

# Mental Models of the Week

* **Shu-Ha-Ri** - a Model that describes mastery paths
* **Circle of Influence** - there is more we can influence than we think we can
* **The Growth Mindset** - always stay open, there is no finish with learning
* **People/Process/Technology** - how it all fits together to make projects successful
* **All Models Are Wrong, Some Are Useful** - be aware that models are simplifications of reality

# How to share knowledge (aka mental models)?


## Create a One-Pager using PairSensing

The one-pager contains a tweetable summary, a concise description, a compilation of further reading and an illustration of the topic.
Using the PairSensing workshop format, all of this will exist after one hour.

# Practice - Start with PairSensing (the Tweet part)

1. Go together in pairs
2. Create Tweets (140chars)
   1. Go to our worksheet, find your frame (online). Grab a post-it.
   2. Scan the shared material for the topic. ⏲️5min
   3. Individually, write a tweetable text on the topic. Share afterwards. ⏲️3min
   4. Repeat. ⏲️3min
   5. In ⏲️4min, agree on a single tweet text or compile one. Write it down on a sticky note.
3. Share your tweet with the group in ⏲️30s.

# Project Liftoff

## What is it, Why are we doing it

When projects start, a liftoff generates the momentum teams need to overcome the inertia presented by lack of common purpose, unclear communication channels, undefined working relationships, and other areas of ambiguity. A liftoff also provides the positive force that moves a project toward its destination — successful delivery.

## How are we doing it

Today: with the help of a Project Canvas. Aha! 👀
