2. Round: Clarifying Questions?
3. ‚è≤Ô∏è10min Perfection Round (Popup)
   1. Perfector rates the agreement on a scale of 1..10 based on how much value the Perfector believes he or she can add.
   2. Perfector says **‚ÄúWhat I liked about the agreement was X,‚Äù** and proceeds to list the qualities of the agreement the Perfector thought were of high quality or should be amplified.
   3. Perfector offers the improvements to the agreement required for it to be rated a 10 by saying **‚ÄúTo make it a ten, you would have to do X.‚Äù**

# Team Agreement, what's left

1. Let's form a crew of 3 - **Protocol Checkers** (team agreements, time etc.)
2. Let's form a crew of 3 - **Energize Crew** (helping with team agreement 6.)

``` none
Energizers are activities used in workshops and group situations
to help participants be more alert and active;
they can also be an important way of people getting to know
and understand one another.

# What is a Project?

> A Project is a temporary, unique and progressive attempt or endeavor made to produce some kind of a tangible or intangible result (a unique product, service, benefit, competitive advantage, etc.). It usually includes a series of interrelated tasks that are planned for execution over a fixed period of time and within certain requirements and limitations such as cost, quality, performance, others.

# What is Project Management?

> Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to deliver something of value to people. The development of software for an improved business process, the construction of a building, the relief effort after a natural disaster, the expansion of sales into a new geographic market - these are all examples of projects.
